# Shaastra-Techathon
The solution for the IIT Madras Shaastra Techathon AI/ML challenge is presented in the form of Python notebook along with the instruction to run the entire notebook. The major instructions to follow while running the file is given below. I would Kindly request you to follow these set of instruction before running the file in your Personal computer.

Instructions to Run the Code
1. Set Up the Environment:
    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Install necessary libraries if not already installed. You can use pip to install them: pip install pandas/numpy/scikit-learn
2. Prepare the Data:
     Download the train and test datasets and place them in the specified directories. The paths in the code assume the following locations:
               Training data: /kaggle/input/traind/train_data_covid.csv
               Test data: /kaggle/input/test-data/test_data_covid.csv
     Ensure that these paths are correct. If your files are in different locations, update the paths in the code accordingly.
3. Run the code:
      My copy and pasting my work in the attached file in your suitable environment you can run the code without any inconvenience and we can get the required result
4. Final Steps: 
      Download the Submission File:
            For Google Colab, use the provided code to download the submission.csv file to your local machine.
            For Kaggle, the file will be available in the output directory.
            For Jupyter Notebook, the file will be saved in the working directory where the notebook is running.
